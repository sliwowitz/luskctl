# Example codexctl configuration file
#
# Copy this file to one of the following locations (first existing wins):
#  - ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/codexctl/config.yml (user override)
#  - /etc/codexctl/config.yml (system-wide default)
#
# Notes:
#  - The CLI command `codexctl config` shows which paths and files are used.

ui:
  # Default first task port for UI mode (subsequent tasks will auto-increment
  # from this base if the port is busy).
  base_port: 7860

envs:
  # Shared persistent host directory for credentials/config that are mounted
  # into task containers (CLI and UI):
  #   - <base_dir>/_codex-config         → /home/dev/.codex (rw)
  #   - <base_dir>/_claude-config        → /home/dev/.claude (rw, CLI only)
  #   - <base_dir>/_ssh-config-<project> → /home/dev/.ssh   (ro)
  # Default for system-wide installs: /var/lib/codexctl/envs
  # You can override per user or system by editing this file.
  # base_dir: /var/lib/codexctl/envs

paths:
  # User projects root (per-user overlays). Each project is a subdirectory
  # containing a project.yml, e.g. ${user_projects_root}/myproj/project.yml
  # Default: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/codexctl/projects
  # user_projects_root: ~/.config/codexctl/projects

  # Writable state root (tasks, caches, etc.).
  # System default (root): /var/lib/codexctl
  # User default:          ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/codexctl
  # state_root: ~/.local/share/codexctl

  # Build artifacts root for generated files.
  # If not set, defaults to: <state_root>/build
  # build_root: ~/.local/share/codexctl/build

# Note: GPU passthrough is a per-project opt-in only. Configure it in
# <project>/project.yml under `run.gpus` (true or "all"). There is no
# global or environment switch.
