"""Service facade for common cross-cutting operations.

Provides a single entry point for operations that both the CLI and TUI
frontends use, reducing the number of direct service-module imports
required by the presentation layer.

The facade re-exports key service functions and provides composite
helpers for multi-step workflows like project initialization.
